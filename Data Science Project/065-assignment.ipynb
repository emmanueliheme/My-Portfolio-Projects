    "In this assignment, you're going to focus on business owners in the United States. You'll start by examining some demographic characteristics of the group, such as age, income category, and debt vs home value. Then you'll select high-variance features, and create a clustering model to divide small business owners into subgroups. Finally, you'll create some visualizations to highlight the differences between these subgroups. Good luck! üçÄ\n",
