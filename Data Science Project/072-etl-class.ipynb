    "In the last lesson, we focused on exploratory data analysis. Specifically, we extracted information from our MongoDB database in order to describe some characteristics of the DS Lab applicant pool ‚Äî country of origin, age, and education level. In this lesson, our goal is to design our experiment, and that means we'll need to go beyond extracting information. We'll also need to make some transformations in our data and then load it back into our database.\n",

    "In Data Science and Data Engineering, the process of taking data from a source, changing it, and then loading it into a database is called ETL, which is short for extract, transform, load. ETL tends to be more programming-intensive than other data science tasks like visualization, so we'll also spend time in this lesson exploring Python as an object-oriented programming language. Specifically, we'll create our own Python class to contain our ETL processes.\n",

    "A hypothesis is an informed guess about what we think is going to happen in an experiment. We probably hope that whatever we're trying out is going to work, but it's important to maintain a healthy degree of skepticism. Science experiments are designed to demonstrate what does work, not what doesn't, so we always start out by assuming that whatever we're about to do won't make a difference (even if we hope it will). The idea that an experimental intervention won't change anything is called a null hypothesis ( ùêª0\n",
    " ), and every experiment either rejects the null hypothesis (meaning the intervention worked), or fails to reject the null hypothesis (meaning it didn't).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mirror image of the null hypothesis is called an alternate hypothesis ( ùêªùëé\n",
    " ), and it proceeds from the idea that whatever we're about to do actually will work. If I'm trying to figure out whether exercising is going to help me lose weight, the null hypothesis says that if I exercise, I won't lose any weight. The alternate hypothesis says that if I exercise, I will lose weight.\n",
