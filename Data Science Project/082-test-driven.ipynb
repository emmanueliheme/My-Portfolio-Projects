    "In the previous lesson, we learned how to get data from an API. In this lesson, we have two goals. First, we'll take the code we used to access the API and build an AlphaVantageAPI class. This will allow us to reuse our code. Second, we'll create a SQLRepository class that will help us load our stock data into a SQLite database and then extract it for later use. Additionally, we'll build this code using a technique called test driven development, where we'll use assert statements to make sure everything is working properly. That way, we'll avoid issues later when we build our application.\n",

    "We've spent a lot of time so far looking at this data, but what does it actually represent? It turns out the stock market is a lot like any other market: people buy and sell goods. The prices of those goods can go up or down depending on factors like supply and demand. In the case of a stock market, the goods being sold are stocks (also called equities or securities), which represent an ownership stake in a corporation.\n",

    "During each trading day, the price of a stock will change, so when we're looking at whether a stock might be a good investment, we look at four types of numbers: open, high, low, close, volume. Open is exactly what it sounds like: the selling price of a share when the market opens for the day. Similarly, close is the selling price of a share when the market closes at the end of the day, and high and low are the respective maximum and minimum prices of a share over the course of the day. Volume is the number of shares of a given stock that have been bought and sold that day. Generally speaking, a firm whose shares have seen a high volume of trading will see more price variation of the course of the day than a firm whose shares have been more lightly traded.\n",
