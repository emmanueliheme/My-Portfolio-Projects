The accuracy score will be amazing, but it won't tell us what we really need to know.\n",

As a data scientist, you'll often need to decide whether you want a model with better precision or better recall. What you choose will depend on how to intend to use your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at two examples, one where recall is the priority and one where precision is more important. First, let's say you work for a regulatory agency in the European Union that assists companies and investors navigate insolvency proceedings. You want to build a model to predict which companies could go bankrupt so that you can send debtors information about filing for legal protection before their company becomes insolvent. The administrative costs of sending information to a company is €500. The legal costs to the European court system if a company doesn't file for protection before bankruptcy is €50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a model like this, we want to focus on recall, because recall is all about quantity. A model that prioritizes recall will cast the widest possible net, which is the way to approach this problem. We want to send information to as many potentially-bankrupt companies as possible, because it costs a lot less to send information to a company that might not become insolvent than it does to skip a company that does.\n",

    "For the second example, let's say we work at a private equity firm that purchases distressed businesses, improve them, and then sells them for a profit. You want to build a model to predict which companies will go bankrupt so that you can purchase them ahead of your competitors. If the firm purchases a company that is indeed insolvent, it can make a profit of €100 million or more. But if it purchases a company that isn't insolvent and can't be resold at a profit, the firm will lose €250 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a model like this, we want to focus on precision. If we're trying to maximize our profit, the quality of our predictions is much more important than the quantity of our predictions. It's not a big deal if we don't catch every single insolvent company, but it's definitely a big deal if the companies we catch don't end up becoming insolvent.\n",
