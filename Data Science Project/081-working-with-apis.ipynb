    "You can't build a model without data, right? In previous projects, we've worked with data stored in files (like a CSV) or databases (like MongoDB or SQL). In this project, we're going to get our data from a web server using an API. So in this lesson, we'll learn what an API is and how to extract data from one.

These parameters provide additional information that will change the operation's behavior. This is similar to the way we pass arguments into functions in Python.\n",
