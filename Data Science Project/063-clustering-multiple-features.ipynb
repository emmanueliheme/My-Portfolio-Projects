    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we built a K-Means model to create clusters of respondents to the Survey of Consumer Finances. We made our clusters by looking at two features only, but there are hundreds of features in the dataset that we didn't take into account and that could contain valuable information. In this lesson, we'll examine all the features, selecting five to create clusters with. After we build our model and choose an appropriate number of clusters, we'll learn how to visualize multi-dimensional clusters in a 2D scatter plot using something called principal component analysis (PCA).\n",

    "\n",
    "First, take a look at the DEBT variable. You might think that it would scale as net worth increases, but it doesn't. The lowest amount of debt is carried by the households in cluster 2, even though the value of their houses (shown in green) is roughly the same. You can't really tell from this data what's going on, but one possibility might be that the people in cluster 2 have enough money to pay down their debts, but not quite enough money to leverage what they have into additional debts. The people in cluster 3, by contrast, might not need to worry about carrying debt because their net worth is so high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since we started out this project looking at home values, take a look at the relationship between DEBT and HOUSES. The value of the debt for the people in cluster 0 is higher than the value of their houses, suggesting that most of the debt being carried by those people is tied up in their mortgages — if they own a home at all. Contrast that with the other three clusters: the value of everyone else's debt is lower than the value of their homes.\n",
